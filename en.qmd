### Fear and Anxiety

* Fear and anxiety are both adaptive responses that promote threat avoidance.
* Key difference: certainty of threat  

  * Fear: an imminent and certain threat  
  * Anxiety: an ambiguous and uncertain threat

* When excessive, they impair daily functioning = anxiety disorders


### Anxiety Disorders

Anxiety disorders are psychiatric conditions characterized by excessive fear and anxiety.

* Number of patients: 300 million worldwide
* Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a major treatment; treatment resistance and relapse remain challenges

→ Understanding the cognitive and behavioral mechanisms of anxiety is important

### Anxiety and Attentional Bias

One cognitive-behavioral characteristic associated with anxiety is attentional bias.

* In anxious individuals, early attention is biased toward threat-related stimuli compared with typical levels.
* Over time, attention tends to avoid threat-related stimuli more than typical levels.

Dot-probe task

* Two faces (neutral vs. threatening) are presented on the left and right, followed by a probe on one side.
* Reaction time to the probe is measured.
* Reaction times are shorter for probes presented on the side that was attended before probe onset.

Current issues

* Stimuli are static, so the variability of threat intensity cannot be controlled.
* Ecological validity is insufficient to elicit social anxiety.

### Anxiety and Maladaptation to Volatility

* One cognitive-behavioral characteristic associated with anxiety is maladaptation to volatility.
* Individuals may fail to learn how changeable the environment is, and have difficulty dissociating environmental changes from incidental noise.

:::: {.column width="45%"}

* A study that examined the relationship with trait anxiety by orthogonally manipulating environmental volatility and stochastic fluctuations.
* Reversal learning task: a task in which the reward rule reverses midway (e.g., in a k-armed bandit task, the mean reward reverses during the task).
* Trait anxiety is associated with the value of lose-shiftor win-stay.
* Tasks rely on abstract feedback, so the elicitation of anxiety is limited.

* Explanations often reduce effects to learning rates (beliefs about volatility), leaving unclear how they relate to approach/avoidance toward threat-related stimuli.

### Aim

We aim to explain uncertainty-related maladaptation observed in reversal learning tasks in terms of threat sensitivity, which has a clear relationship to approach and avoidance toward threat stimuli.

* This is motivated by the question of which aspect is primary in anxiety-related cognition and behavior: the commonality with fear (threat avoidance) or the distinctive response to uncertainty.


### Research Question

What is the primary cause of reversal-learning maladaptation observed in individuals with high anxiety: threat sensitivity or prior beliefs about volatility?

---

### Hypotheses

H1: Threat-sensitivity hypothesis

* Cognitive-behavioral characteristics of anxiety are mainly explained by heightened threat sensitivity.
* High threat sensitivity suppresses exploration, leading to impaired learning and consequently reversal maladaptation.

H2: Volatility-prior hypothesis

* Cognitive-behavioral characteristics of anxiety are mainly explained by high precision of prior beliefs about volatility.
* Reversal maladaptation arises because learning about how changeable the world is fails to progress.

We treat H1 (threat-sensitivity hypothesis) as the primary hypothesis and set H2 (volatility-prior hypothesis) as a comparison hypothesis.

We design two models corresponding to the two hypotheses, and test the hypotheses via model comparison.

### Overview of the Behavioral Task

Participants give a speech in a virtual online-meeting environment.

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="55%"}

**Basic setup**

* Participants give a brief 1-minute speech while watching a video.
* The video displays two virtual audience faces (left/right) and a score.
* The score-generation rule described below is not disclosed to participants.
* Participants aim to maximize the score.
* The virtual audience is generated artificially using face-morphing images.
* The audience’s affective valence changes over time according to the conditions described later.
* Gaze during the speech is measured with an eye tracker.

### Gaze Measures

* Proportion of gaze directed to each audience member
* Latency to the first fixation
* Speed of gaze adaptation after reversal
* Gaze-switching frequency


### Score Rule and Reversal

* The displayed score increases or decreases depending on whether the participant looked at the audience member with higher affective valence or lower affective valence in the previous time bin.
* Initially, looking at the higher-valence audience yields +1 point, whereas looking at the lower-valence audience yields −1 point.
* When the rule reverses, looking at the higher-valence audience yields −1 point, whereas looking at the lower-valence audience yields +1 point.

The purpose of score feedback is to encourage participants to learn the rule.

### Conditions and Predicted Gaze Behavior

**Conditions**

We define four conditions given by the combination of (i) the magnitude of affective-valence variability and (ii) the magnitude of reversal frequency.

**Predicted gaze behavior**

H1: Threat-sensitivity hypothesis

* Across pre- and post-reversal periods, gaze toward the audience member who is on average more negative tends to be relatively reduced (suppressed exploration).
* After reversal, even when the situation switches such that one should look at the lower-valence audience, the shift of gaze is delayed and score recovery is slow.  
* Reversal maladaptation appears as learning delay due to insufficient exploration.

H2: Volatility-belief hypothesis

* Gaze tends to become unstable toward the audience member whose valence changes more frequently.
* Adaptation after reversal is delayed especially under high-noise conditions, and gaze tends to become unstable.
* Reversal maladaptation appears as unstable updating.

---


### Model

We use a Bayesian inference model.

* The affective valence of each virtual audience member is estimated with a Kalman filter.
* Gaze behavior (gaze proportion in each time bin) is selected by minimizing expected free energy $G(\pi)$.

$$
G(\pi)
=
\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{q(o\mid \pi)}\!\left[*\log p(o)\right]}_{\text{Risk}}
-
\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{q(o\mid \pi)}\!\left[
D_{\mathrm{KL}}\!\left(q(s\mid o,\pi)\,\|\,q(s\mid \pi)\right)
\right]}_{\text{Information gain}}
+
\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{q(s\mid \pi)}\!\left[H\!\left(p(o\mid s)\right)\right]}_{\text{Ambiguity}}
$$


::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="55%"}

* Expected free energy can be decomposed into three terms—risk, information gain, and ambiguity—capturing behavior as a trade-off among these components.
* Threat sensitivity primarily affects the risk term via the preference parameter \(C\).
* Beliefs about environmental volatility primarily affect the information-gain term via the transition probability matrix \(B\).
